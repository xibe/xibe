I love writing, learning, sharing, and technology. I particularly like to write to share what I have learned about a technology - especially when it concerns the Web, its standards and best practices, and its communities.

Since the beginning of this century, I've made it my job to help developers and creatives better understand both the classic programming languages and the latest framework trends, and to make their projects shine.

I know how to adapt to the platforms, languages and needs of the communities I'm working with. I act as a representative, liaison point, diplomat and moderator to contribute to the technical ecosystem in which I participate.

This GitHub repository is pretty empty as I don't play with open-source projects as much as I would like to.

Nevertheless...
